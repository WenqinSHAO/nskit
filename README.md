#nskit

_nskit_ is not an effort to re-engineer [netkit](http://wiki.netkit.org/index.php/Main_Page) or  [Kathara](https://github.com/Kidel/Kathara) or [mininet](https://github.com/mininet/mininet).
I just find [network namesapce](https://lwn.net/Articles/580893/) an well-maintained, simple, neutral yet sufficient tool to deploy and simulate a network within a single machine.
Therefore, I try to (for the sake of my own pleasure and trouble) to facilitate the following tasks:
1. topology specification via json or an interactive js script;
2. visual topology inspection from file and runtime;
3. generalized and extensible automation for network related configurations;
4. some basic deployment supports for routing functions, say BIRD;
5. save runtime config (not the status).
